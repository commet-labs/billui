BillUI is a collection of composable, accessible, and customizable billing components for React applications. Built on top of shadcn/ui primitives and fully compatible with the shadcn registry.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add pricing-card --from https://billui.com/api/registry
```

## Components

- **Accessible** - Built with accessibility in mind using semantic HTML
- **Customizable** - Style with Tailwind CSS, or bring your own styles
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with exported types
- **shadcn Compatible** - Install via the shadcn CLI, just like native components
