description: Open source billing components to help you ship faster. Built for the community.

billui is an open collection of billing components for React, built on top of shadcn/ui and distributed via the shadcn registry. The goal is simple: **help you ship billing UI faster**.

This is my small contribution to the open source community that taught me so much. {'<3'}

## Not a library—an open component distribution

Like shadcn/ui, billui is not a typical install-from-NPM library. It's an open collection you can copy, modify, and customize directly in your codebase. You own the code. No wrappers, no overrides, no fighting with the library.

Billing UI is deceptively complex. Pricing cards, usage meters, invoice tables, subscription management—each one has edge cases and design decisions that take time to get right. billui gives you battle-tested starting points so you can focus on what makes your product unique.

## Why billui?

- **Open source & copy-first**: Direct access to source so you can adapt components to your design system
- **Ship faster**: Stop rebuilding the same billing components from scratch
- **shadcn compatible**: Install via the shadcn CLI, works with your existing setup
- **Composable**: Build complex billing UIs from simple, reusable primitives
- **Accessible**: Built with semantic HTML and accessibility in mind
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with exported types
