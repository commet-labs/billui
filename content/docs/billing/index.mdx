BillUI provides a set of composable, accessible, and customizable components for building billing and pricing interfaces. All components are compatible with shadcn/ui and can be installed via the shadcn CLI.

## Installation

You can install BillUI components using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add pricing-card --from https://billui.com/api/registry
```

Or for local development:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add pricing-card --from http://localhost:3000/api/registry
```

## Philosophy

BillUI components follow these principles:

1. **Composable** - Components are built using a compound component pattern, giving you full control over structure and styling.

2. **Accessible** - All components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines and support keyboard navigation.

3. **Customizable** - Built with Tailwind CSS and CVA (class-variance-authority) for easy customization.

4. **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with exported types for all component props.

## Requirements

- React 18+
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ or 4.x
- A project with shadcn/ui CSS variables configured (or equivalent)
